Map description
---------------

This is a map of salt storage domes, generally used to store road salt for reducing ice on public roads. I have chosen domes in particular for their distinctive and easily recognizable shape. This shape is optimized for the angle of repose that a pile of salt makes.

WHAT BULBOUS BUDDIES! WHAT HEARTY HEMISPHERES! WHAT CURVY COMRADES! WHAT CHONKY CHUMS! WHAT ABSOLUTE UNITS!
